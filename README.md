# MVA_DeepL

Two Praticals for the "Deep Learning" course (Master MVA).

- NLP Practical: We cover monolingual word and sentence em- beddings, multilingual word embeddings and sentence classification with Bag-of-Vectors (BoW) and LSTMs.

- RL Practical: We Implement Deep Reinforcement learning algorithms and test them on the following game: A rat runs on an island (modelled by a grid) and tries to eat as much as possible.
